<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
