<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
