The alarm system is simply one of 2 we checked that includes an external siren, and we're impressed that it likewise includes a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, even more dissuading anyone from attempting to break in to your residential or commercial property.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
