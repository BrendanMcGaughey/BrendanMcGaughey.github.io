<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and fraud. Idea: Often keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of pricey false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it immediately shut off the heater. You can automatically make the smart lights turn on to scare away prospective robbers if the motion sensing units are triggered.</p>

Certainly not perfect-- but the representative asked forgiveness and delivered her replacement control panel over night.</p>
