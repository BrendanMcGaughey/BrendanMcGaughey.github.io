<p>Our alarm systems may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an offense. As soon as a zone has actually been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
