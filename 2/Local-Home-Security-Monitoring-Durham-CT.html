<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the need for additional wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch.
