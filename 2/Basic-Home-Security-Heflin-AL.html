<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective culprits are less most likely to commit criminal offense if they believe they are being watched or have a higher danger of being collared. This is also referred to as the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity prevention method, which argues that opportunities to upset can be lowered by modifying a range of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of an offender being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, reducing rewards from crime commission, and reducing justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<h3>Home Protection Security System Heflin AL 36264</h3>
