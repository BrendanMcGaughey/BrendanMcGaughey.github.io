<p>Another important topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video photo; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
