<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the specific very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric current.

Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
