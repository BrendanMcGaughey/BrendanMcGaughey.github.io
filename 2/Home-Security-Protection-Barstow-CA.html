<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you stroll by.
