In Britain, where cameras have actually been thoroughly deployed in public places, sociologists studying the issue have actually discovered that they have not lowered criminal activity. "When the criminal offense and offence figures were adapted to take account of the basic down trend in offences and criminal activities," criminologists found in one research study, "reductions were noted in particular classifications but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had decreased criminal activity overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Office also discovered that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 research study, likewise for the British government).</p>
