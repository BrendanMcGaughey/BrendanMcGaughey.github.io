A couple of models utilize batteries, making placement more flexible, however this needs other compromises, which we highlight in the Competition section. Wi-Fi protection also affects where you position a camera: If you wish to put a camera in a spot that does not get a good Wi-Fi signal, consider updating your router or including an extender or repeater. (For a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for Most People)" and The Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good guideline that if your smart device or laptop computer gets good Wi-Fi reception in the area you wish to mount the camera, you likely won't have a problem.</p>

If there are three select fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single fixed camera can just see one.

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
