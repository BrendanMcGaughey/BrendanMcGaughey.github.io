<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries.

In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the need for more wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, typically by means of 110VAC power.</p>
