<p>While the prices for both packages are affordable given what they offer, lots of clients have left dissatisfactory reviews on Yelp and elsewhere, suffering poor customer care and deceptive marketing strategies.

Overall, Brinks Home Security offers a quality product for a good rate in a congested market.</p>
<p>What we like: Allied Home Security is a local company and Brinks home security dealership that provides free same day installation and free activation.

Despite the hefty cost here, there's no external monitoring alternative.</p>
