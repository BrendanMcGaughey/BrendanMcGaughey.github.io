<p>Best Expert Installation Security Company - While some security systems offer simple DIY installation, other companies provide (and in some cases require) professional installation. Expert installation is offered for wireless and hardwired home security systems. Remember that cameras with two-way audio usually work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end. And while this is a quite standard feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>When looking at a typical camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with detail after the truth, which means that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and use up a lot of taping storage area. A lot, in reality, that they need about 4 times the hard disk drive area of 1080p to record the very same length of video footage. If extended video storage is essential, be prepared to spend more cash.</p>
