No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
