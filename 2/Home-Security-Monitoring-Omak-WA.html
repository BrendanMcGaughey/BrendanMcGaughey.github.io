<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you require extra cable televisions. DVR systems are challenging to scale up due to the fact that when every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to acquire a totally new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs also require that the linked cameras remain in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to deteriorate.</p>
