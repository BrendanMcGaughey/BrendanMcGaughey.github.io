Nevertheless, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have crucial fobs and extra sensors, too.</p>
