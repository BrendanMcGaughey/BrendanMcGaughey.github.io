Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen frequently enough.

Considering that this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop alerts (and recording, considering that it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connection issues, with two Hive test units detaching 8 times over 2 months. Scout is extremely simple to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it enables you to manage nearly every aspect of the security system from another location, and it's highly personalized.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
