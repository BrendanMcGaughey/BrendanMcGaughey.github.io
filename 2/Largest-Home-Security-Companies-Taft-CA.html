Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a particular area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will decrease criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

Does the camera shop to an SD card, which you'll require to by hand remove to transfer the information? Does it go to your mobile phone, or upload to services like Dropbox?

Many wired security systems have professional monitoring but do not have access to remote monitoring.

With a wired system, you will be counting on your security company rather of being able to check up on your home yourself.</p>
