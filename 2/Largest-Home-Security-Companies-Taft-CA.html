Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a particular area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will decrease criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
