ADT utilizes an independent supplier model including third-party dealerships. The dealers determine which equipment to utilize. Costs for systems vary. Larger systems that provide full-house protection with professional monitoring are the most costly choices. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most budget friendly option.</p>

If you get a system with a camera and choose to have it professionally monitored, however, you'll wish to opt for the Interactive plan.</p>
