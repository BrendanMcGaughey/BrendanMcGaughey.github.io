<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community need to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer burglaries across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent.
