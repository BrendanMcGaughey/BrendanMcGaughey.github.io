<p>Every system on our list uses security equipment for under $500, cost effective regular monthly monitoring, and Do It Yourself installation.

<p>Local storage: Some cameras consist of memory-card slots in lieu of, or in addition to, cloud storage, so you can keep video right on the device. It's an attractive feature as it can get rid of the cost of regular monthly storage costs. The downside (if there isn't a cloud backup) is that if a crook steals your camera, he takes your forensic evidence with it. SimpliSafe clients get contract-free security systems without any cancellation charges. Wi-Fi cameras are fantastic for security but also far more.
