<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients understand that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

<p>Another essential topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much image details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.
