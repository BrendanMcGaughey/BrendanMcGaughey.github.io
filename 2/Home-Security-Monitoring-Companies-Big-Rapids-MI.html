<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers realize that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
