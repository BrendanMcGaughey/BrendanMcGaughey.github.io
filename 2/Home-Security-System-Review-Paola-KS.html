<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
