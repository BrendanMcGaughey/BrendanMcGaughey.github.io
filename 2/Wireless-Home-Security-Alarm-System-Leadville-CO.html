Wireless security systems are more integratable and agile, however low signal strength and bad connection are still typical grievances.

<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to use too (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you want to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve.
