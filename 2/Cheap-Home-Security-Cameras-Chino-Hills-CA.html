Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you mean to store and the length of time you plan to keep documented video footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage area quickly.
