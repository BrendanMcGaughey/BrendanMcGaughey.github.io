<p>SimpliSafe might be too minimal for you if you have a bigger home or home you desire to keep an eye on. The only outdoor security camera that's currently readily available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is terrific for keeping an eye on visitors and package shipments, but it leaves other parts of your backyard susceptible. If you have a big yard or outbuildings to protect, this system might not be the very best fit. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q doesn't require a base station-- it connects straight to any Wi-Fi network. But you can connect the Q with other Arlo outdoor and indoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web internet browser.

<p>Whether you decide to go with a Do It Yourself system or choose a professionally installed system, you'll need to pay a month-to-month or annual  fee if you need monitoring, and sometimes, you'll be hit with a monthly fee to settle the cost of hardware parts. With most DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Set, the Ring Alarm Security Set, and the Nest Secure, you acquire the hardware outright and can prevent any monthly charges if you choose to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, fees will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 each month.
