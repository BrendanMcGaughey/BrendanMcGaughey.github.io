<p>Pelco offers video surveillance cameras and video management solutions for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping hotels, centers, and others. IP cameras work by utilizing an IP (IP represents internet procedure) network, often the same data network the rest of a company uses. If bandwidth is a problem, a different network using classification 5 electrical wiring can be utilized. In any case, video information is recorded on a server, which suggests video data can be located on site or in a remote area. After testing, we sent out each of our top choices, as well as the Wyze Webcam v2, to Expense McKinley, head of info security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's moms and dad company), for hack testing. (Expense is also a self-proclaimed paranoid infosec guy.") He evaluated each camera for any impressive security defects and concluded that all of our top picks and the budget plan Wyze Web cam passed basic security requirements and defenses.</p>
