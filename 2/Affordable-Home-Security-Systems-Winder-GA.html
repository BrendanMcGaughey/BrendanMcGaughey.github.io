You don't wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "individuals might learn to be cautious about the periodicals and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals considered to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings underwent extended surveillance.</p>
