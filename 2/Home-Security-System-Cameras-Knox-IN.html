<p>Expert installation was almost the only way to put in a home security system 15 years earlier. Innovation has come such a long way that Do It Yourself systems can offer the same level of security (and often more) with a self installed system. Further, there can be fringe benefits to a Do It Yourself system because they're normally much easier to move to another home if you move. For somebody searching for a more complex setup like home automation, or someone that desires a trained specialist to make the recommendation for the setup, expert installation is a fantastic alternative. We've found that most people that were apprehensive about self installing a home security system in fact ended up discovering the process very easy. There are companies out there like Frontpoint that are known to be especially handy in this stage.</p>
