In Britain, where cameras have actually been extensively deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the concern have actually found that they have not lowered crime. "When the criminal activity and offence figures were adapted to take account of the basic downward pattern in criminal activities and offences," criminologists found in one research study, "reductions were kept in mind in certain classifications however there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had actually decreased criminal offense overall in the city centre."
