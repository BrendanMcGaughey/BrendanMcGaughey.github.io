Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving objects if it identifies an intruder; an useful intercom function that enables the device to act as a smart doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hey there doorbell ); and, considering that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.
