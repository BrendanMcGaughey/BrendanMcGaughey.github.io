<p>Besides resolution, likewise consider the field of vision. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, but not all angles are developed equivalent. Depending on the lens' field of vision, it can see in between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a big range in regards to the camera's vision cone.

In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone going into the shop.

Regrettably, when clients realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
