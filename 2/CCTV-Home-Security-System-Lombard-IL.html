<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers understand that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
