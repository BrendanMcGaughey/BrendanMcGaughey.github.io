<p>If you have an interest in the Google Nest Secure, you'll have the most success in the way of a neatly-integrated home security community by sticking with Nest items. Some of Google Nest's cameras do use facial recognition, but they can't trip alarms (based upon whether they acknowledge someone or otherwise).

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
