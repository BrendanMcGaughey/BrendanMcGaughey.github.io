<p>Amongst IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send data over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video from anywhere. A typical mistaken belief is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free.
