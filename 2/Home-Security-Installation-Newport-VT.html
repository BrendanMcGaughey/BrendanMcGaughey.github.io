<p>Nurse calling systems typically consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's toilet.

<p>Twenty-five years earlier, general and business interactions were mainly concurrent. To accomplish practically anything, someone live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, particularly when dealing with nationwide and global business. The same applies for security and video surveillance.
