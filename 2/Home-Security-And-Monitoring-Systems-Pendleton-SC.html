<p>3 huge benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their mobility, impermanence and expandability. Tenants, unlike homeowners, normally avoid making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can easily be set up at different properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new parts too. Wireless security strategies also enable push-button control of the system and general home automation. If home automation is your primary appeal, check out our list of top systems with home automation features.</p>
<p>For an outdoor camera that does more than record video and send alerts, make certain it deals with other clever devices. Many current outdoor Wi-Fi cameras use support for IFTTT (If This Then That), a web service that uses small programs (applets) that you develop to have the camera interact with other IFTTT-enabled gadgets. For instance, you can have a clever plug turn on a lamp inside your home or trigger an external siren when the camera discovers motion.</p>
