Some people might state that we should not have surveillance cameras in public places. They claim that they invade personal privacy.

<p>If a staff member (relied on entity) brings in a wireless router and plugs it into an unsecured switchport, the entire network can be exposed to anyone within series of the signals. Similarly, if a worker includes a wireless interface to a networked computer using an open USB port, they might produce a breach in network security that would enable access to private products. Nevertheless, there are effective countermeasures (like disabling open switchports during switch setup and VLAN setup to restrict network gain access to) that are readily available to secure both the information and the network it consists of, but such countermeasures must be applied uniformly to all network devices.</p>
<p>On the surface, these two camera categories might appear comparable, though if you had the ability to see within, the distinctions become obvious and distinct.
