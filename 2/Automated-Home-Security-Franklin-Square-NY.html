"When the criminal offense and offence figures were gotten used to take account of the general down trend in crimes and offences," criminologists found in one study, "decreases were kept in mind in particular classifications but there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had actually minimized criminal offense overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the worry of criminal offense (as had a 2002 study, also for the British federal government).</p>
