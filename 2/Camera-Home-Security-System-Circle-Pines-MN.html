The Ring Floodlight Web cam combines two essential devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera detects motion, it switches on its two powerful LED beams as well as its sharp 1080p camera, and begins recording.

<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their portability, expandability and impermanence. Renters, unlike house owners, typically prevent making irreversible modifications to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can easily be set up at different properties in the future, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new components too. Wireless security plans also enable push-button control of the system and basic home automation.
