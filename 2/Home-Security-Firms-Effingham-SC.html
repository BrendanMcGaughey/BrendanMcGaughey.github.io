<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
