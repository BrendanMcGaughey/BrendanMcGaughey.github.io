During testing, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we like that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adjusted to account for pets, too.

<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
