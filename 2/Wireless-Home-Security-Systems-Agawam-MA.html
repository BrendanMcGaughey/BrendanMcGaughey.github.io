This system is what communicates with all of the security sensors and smart-home parts in your house. Numerous connect to a home router, however if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular support, placement is more flexible.

<p>SimpliSafe's equipment features a three-year service warranty and is 100% wireless.

Simplisafe does not include home automation functions, besides Nest integration, which might be a turn off for some.</p>

Due to the fact that contract-based security systems normally don't featured upfront fees. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
