ELERTS is a complimentary smart device app that enables citizens who see something suspicious to take a picture and quickly send it to public safety authorities. For instance, a public transit rider might observe someone behaving suspiciously. Lots of people are fiddling, surfing or texting with their mobile phones.

Reports from mobile phone users can be rapidly reviewed and acted on by Public Safety authorities.</p>

Then, the monitoring company immediately sets to action, connecting with you and informing the authorities.</p>
