<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually tested.

To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize people you've labeled (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>

Frontpoint's detectors are unsusceptible to family pets weighing up to 40 pounds. With ADT, the expert installer can tailor the sensitivity level based on your family pet's size.</p>

It's an attractive feature as it can eliminate the cost of monthly storage fees.
