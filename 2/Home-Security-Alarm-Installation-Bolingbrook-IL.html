<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a number of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you intend to store and the length of time you prepare to keep documented video footage. The video is going to consume up storage area quickly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage when you reach the system's capability, however if you're not cautious, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>

<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>

This technology helps eliminate needless alerts.</p>
