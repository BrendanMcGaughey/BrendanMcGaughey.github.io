<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, expandability and portability. Occupants, unlike property owners, generally avoid making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and installing permanent electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entryways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other elements can easily be established at different residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new parts too. Wireless security plans also allow remote control of the system and basic home automation.
