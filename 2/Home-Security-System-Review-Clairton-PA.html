<p>Slightly more costly than our winning clever alarm, this system was almost as basic to install and, throughout screening, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if one of the sensing units had actually been activated. We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just notifies you when motion is created by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false alerts). Nevertheless, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have key fobs and additional sensors, too.</p>

Woot has also posted great deals on wireless security systems in the past. It's a little bit harder to plan your purchase when shopping at Woot, as the majority of the offers are only available for 24-hours.

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, including clever things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.
