If there are three choose fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single set camera can only see one. This develops a one in three opportunity of catching a specific occurrence on video (either live or tape-recorded). The command center also included a computer designated for submitting occurrence reports online. These can be accessed by management workers at a later date from a database via the computer network.</p>

<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes.
