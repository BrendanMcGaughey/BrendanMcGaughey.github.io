<p>3 huge benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their impermanence, mobility and expandability. Tenants, unlike homeowners, generally avoid making permanent modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other components can quickly be established at various properties later, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new elements too. Wireless security strategies also permit push-button control of the system and basic home automation.
