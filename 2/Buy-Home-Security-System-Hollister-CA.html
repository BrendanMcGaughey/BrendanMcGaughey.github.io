Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.

Generally, the most extreme frequencies produced are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
