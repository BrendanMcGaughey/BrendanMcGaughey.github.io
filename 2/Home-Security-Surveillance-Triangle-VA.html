<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based on our screening, must supply a minimum of a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of complimentary cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will enable the camera to properly detect motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, however it might leave you with tape-recording spaces throughout important security events. If home security is your main issue, we 'd suggest one of our top picks, but the Arlo is fantastic for checking in on household and animals-- or roaming cats sliding around your backyard.</p>
