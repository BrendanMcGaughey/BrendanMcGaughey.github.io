<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day.

<p>A system that requires an agreement might be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems generally don't come with in advance costs. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>

We 'd probably suggest a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint if you're starting from scratch.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving things if it detects an intruder; a helpful intercom function that allows the gadget to function as a smart doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hey there doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.
