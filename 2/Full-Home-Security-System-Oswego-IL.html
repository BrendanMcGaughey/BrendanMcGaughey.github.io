Just think just how much info you give away when you do an easy online grocery order: your name, your address, the kind of things you buy, what times you'll be around (and, by extension, what times you'll be out). You might even provide guidelines on how to get into your building. As just recently as 10 years ago, consumers did not have access to innovation that let them handle their own home security systems.

In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
