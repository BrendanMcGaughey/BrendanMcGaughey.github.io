<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the precise same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which suggests. If someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm.
