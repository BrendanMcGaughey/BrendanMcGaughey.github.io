<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
