<h2>Night Vision, Wireless & Wired Randolph</h2>
<p>An outdoor camera is ideal for watching on what's occurring beyond your home. These devices are weatherproof and usually need a nearby GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter) outlet to provide power, although there are a handful of battery-powered designs out there.

They are fairly simple to install, however if you're not familiar or comfy with electrical circuitry, you may want to have a professional electrical contractor do the job.</p>
