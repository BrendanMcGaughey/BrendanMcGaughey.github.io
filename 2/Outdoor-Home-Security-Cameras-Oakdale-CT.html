CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance strategy, which argues that chances to upset can be decreased by altering a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being nabbed, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal offense, decreasing rewards from criminal offense commission, and minimizing justifications that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This means that the culprit needs to be aware of the added surveillance for it to attain its desired impact.</p>
