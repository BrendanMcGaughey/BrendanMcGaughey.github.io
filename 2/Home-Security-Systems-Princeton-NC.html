A lot of wise cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as easy as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives easier and Hive's ecosystem lives up to that. It's all the function with no disappointment.</p>
<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides complimentary advantages like person detection, familiar-face notifies, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 each month.)

Nevertheless, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next.
