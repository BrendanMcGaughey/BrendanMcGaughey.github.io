Life can get stressful in some cases, and it can be tough keeping track of whatever around you. Thankfully, a surveillance camera can lend an additional pair of eyes and serve as lookout for you and your household.

It features HD live streaming, motion informs, individual alerts and access to the Nest Aware service option. Beginning at $5 per month, a Nest Aware membership uses innovative functions like facial acknowledgment. Produce a database of friends and family and get alerts informing you "Molly" or "Andrew" is at the door.</p>
