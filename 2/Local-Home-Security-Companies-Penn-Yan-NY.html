We are supplying CCTV Installs to our customers in Lake Worth, Jupiter, Stuart, Boca Raton, Delray Beach, Palm Beach, West Palm Beach, Riviera Beach and FL locations, that have big optical and digital power of zoom. If you have an expansive home, common wireless security systems may not be the best alternative as they're restricted in range.</p>
<p>When looking at a regular camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to solve detail after the truth, which suggests that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are large and use up a lot of recording storage space. So much, in reality, that they require about four times the hard disk area of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more cash if extended video storage is essential.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
