<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
