<p>Our burglar alarms may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge an offense. Once a zone has actually been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
