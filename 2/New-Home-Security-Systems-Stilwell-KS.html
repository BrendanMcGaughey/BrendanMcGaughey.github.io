<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
