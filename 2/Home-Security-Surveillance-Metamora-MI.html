<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of straight plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera.

DVR systems are tough to scale up due to the fact that when every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you require to purchase an entirely new DVR prior to adding another camera to the system. DVRs likewise require that the linked cameras be in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to deteriorate.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
