<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes.
