As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
