When the cameras were hooked up, we monitored day and night activities, including the comings and goings of 2 grownups, one kid, and a canine.

<p>Our burglar alarms may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge an offense. When a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
