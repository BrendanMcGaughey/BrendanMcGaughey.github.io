<p>When it concerns technology, dependability is an extremely subjective matter, depending upon which features and benefits an individual favors. Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, however low signal strength and poor connection are still common problems. Hardwired systems require minimal upkeep, and except a general power outage, are more difficult to interfere with.

The systems have adjustable electronic devices to allow installers to change the level of sensitivity of the alarm detectors to the fit specific ecological conditions. The tuning of the system is normally achieved during commissioning of the detection devices.</p>
