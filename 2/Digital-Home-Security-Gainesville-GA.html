<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
