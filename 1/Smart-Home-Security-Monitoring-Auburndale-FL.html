<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our screening-- during the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We must note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the picture quality based upon available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
