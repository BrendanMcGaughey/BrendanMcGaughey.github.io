<p>Numerous home security systems are managed by smart devices and that trend will continue. Systems will have less wall-mounted keypads, and instead, give more controls to more devices. Wireless door, window, glass break, motion, freeze and water sensing units communicate with a hub or base station in your house. The main control must be centrally located in your home and have full time non-switched AC power. Wired alarm systems are incredibly trustworthy and you don't need to fret about their battery running out. However, they are repaired in location, might require professional installation, and they're not portable.</p>
