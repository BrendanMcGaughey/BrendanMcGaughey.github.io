<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. ADT also has more industry experience and more monitoring centers than SimpliSafe.

No complex hardware such as a digital video recorder (DVR) is required on-site. To see your center in real-time and examine recent occasions, all you need is a password. You can log in and do everything you require. Better still, you no longer require to fret about having an IT specialist on staff to handle the hardware or deal with changing it every 3-5 years.</p>
