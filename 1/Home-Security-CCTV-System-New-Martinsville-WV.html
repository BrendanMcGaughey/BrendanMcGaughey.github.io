The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company.

When the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
