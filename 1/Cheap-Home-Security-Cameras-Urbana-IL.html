<p>Ring is one of the greatest names in the plugged-in home security video game, and the Ring Indoor Webcam is developed to couple with the company's Ring - Always Home app, as well as,'s Turner points out, video doorbells. You can even combine several cameras together on the app, if you so wish. Remember that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But since a lot of retail theft wouldn't trip an alarm anyway (a staff member slipping some additional money while giving a customer modification, for example), we believe it's more important to have top quality images so you have the proof you need. Which's what Nest gives you.</p>
<p>To assess response times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of five times, utilizing contact and motion sensors. Nevertheless, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
