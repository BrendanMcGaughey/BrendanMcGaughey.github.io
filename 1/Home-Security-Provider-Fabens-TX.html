The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image.

We are confirming with Arlo whether our system was faulty, and so we may revisit this evaluation. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of footage to the cloud.
