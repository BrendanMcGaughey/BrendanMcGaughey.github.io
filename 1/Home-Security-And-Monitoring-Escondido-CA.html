<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even recognize people you have actually identified (after a knowing period).

<p>Many wireless home security systems are can be installed by the house owner and have an easy setup procedure.

<p>Potential intruders by and large prefer much easier targets with the least amount of danger included. Homeowners likewise often install phony security cameras using the same reasoning. It makes good sense that alarm indications alone will discourage some burglars. However, this strategy isn't sure-fire: robbers have actually ended up being savvy to the practice of posting phony signs and cameras, and ever-bolder wrongdoers might be going to take a threat. For that reason, each property owner needs to consider their own risk tolerance, but it's generally worth buying a real home security system that uses strong assurance.</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is expensive, extra sensors are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
