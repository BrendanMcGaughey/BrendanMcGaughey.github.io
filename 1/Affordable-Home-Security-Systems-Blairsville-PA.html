<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
