<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security bundle, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer break-ins throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. However, the truth that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute substantially to authorities capability to collar intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support police action to alarmed properties) a inefficient and costly method to burglary decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
