This means you will get emergency service, you will pay less, it is much easier to call the company, and you will be promoting the local economy.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, typically by means of 110VAC power.</p>
<p>A typical factor for a user to buy a wireless security system is to update from an older, hardwired system.

If you have old hardwired devices, you can interface them with a wireless panel by adding a wired to wireless converter, such as the Honeywell 5800C2W.</p>
