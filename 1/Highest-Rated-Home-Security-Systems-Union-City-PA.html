<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
