<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
