Whereas dome cameras are smaller and more discreet. These compact cameras are ideal for monitoring a bigger area such as your front or back garden and can follow movement with ease.</p>

<p>Take note of the existing lighting in the areas where you want to install security cameras. Try to find the night vision range of each camera and consider how much location you wish to cover.
