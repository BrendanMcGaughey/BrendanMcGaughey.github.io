<p>As for how to use one, they work the same as many other security cameras and hook into your existing doorbell setup. In some cases you do not even need to hardwire them, depending upon which model you choose. Similar to any security system, the more equipment you include, the more expensive it gets.

It will inform you if the motion sensors or entry sensors have actually been set off.

Commercial cameras exceed their less expensive cousins since they have larger internal video sensing units and higher-quality elements that can adjust and record exceptional low light video.</p>
