<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a kind of situational crime avoidance developed to avoid both individual and home crime and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer images of a specific area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011).
