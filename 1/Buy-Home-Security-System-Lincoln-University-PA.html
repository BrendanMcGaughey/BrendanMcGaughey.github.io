<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
