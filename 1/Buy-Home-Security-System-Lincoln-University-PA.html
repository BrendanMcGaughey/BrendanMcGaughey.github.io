<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Need to be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
