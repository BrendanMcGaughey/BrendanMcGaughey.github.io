Numerous insurance provider provide discount rates on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm systems. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of police departments use several "free" incorrect alarms prior to imposing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is considerable right from the start.
