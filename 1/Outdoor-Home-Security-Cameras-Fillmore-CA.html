When setting your alarm to make sure all windows and doors are secure, please take additional caution.

<p>Alarm monitoring is part of a total home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (frequently extremely high decibel so that you can hear it as can neighbors in some cases) and sounds an alarm with a professional monitoring company.

<p>The NVR removes these problems, since it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder before buying.</p>
