<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
