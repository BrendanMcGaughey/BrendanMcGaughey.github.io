<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then relayed over a local location network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review.
