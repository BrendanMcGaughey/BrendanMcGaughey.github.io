While enhancements over the last few years have made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own special wireless innovation, which can't be disrupted by other signals), concerns continue over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>

<p>Another essential subject to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much suffices. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video image; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it pertains to surveillance cameras, there are some challenging consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
