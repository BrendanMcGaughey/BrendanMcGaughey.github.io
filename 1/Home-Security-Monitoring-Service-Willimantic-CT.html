Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
