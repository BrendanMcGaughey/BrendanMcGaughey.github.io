<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats since this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest perpetrator for brief battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capability is a bit limited to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>Given that the glass housing does not get in the way, they aren't rather as vandal-proof as dome cameras, but they make up for it in capabilities. In addition to being fantastic for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for low-light and infrared considering that the glass real estate doesn't restrain the lens.
