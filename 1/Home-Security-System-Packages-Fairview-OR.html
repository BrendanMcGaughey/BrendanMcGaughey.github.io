<p>Because it's more complex than it should be, we do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>A self-monitored home security system depends on the homeowner to watch their home and contact authorities in the event of an emergency. A self-monitored system does not imply a house owner has to compromise any features.

Unlike other monitoring choices, self-monitored systems do not have a regular monthly monitoring fee.</p>

When your alarm gets triggered, you get an alert, at which point you can call the authorities. You need to install and buy Power Supply as source of power. All our HD CCTV security camera systems include "power supply" so you do not need to look any more however considering that we are comparing 2 technologoies, if you were to buy our IP Security Camera Systems, they come with PoE compliant NVRs so you can utilize ethernet cable to power up your IP security cameras.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
