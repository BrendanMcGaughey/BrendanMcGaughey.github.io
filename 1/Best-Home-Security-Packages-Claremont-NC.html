We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top areas.

Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send images of a particular area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011).

Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including clever things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.
