<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top areas.

Still, if innovation has made us vulnerable, then it can likewise make us secure. Tech companies have actually been pushing hard to innovate in the linked home CCTV camera space.

Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send images of a particular area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will decrease criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other neighboring areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including clever things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. But the Secure is expensive, extra sensors are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not include fire alarms or camera backups-- is also pricey if you do not devote to a three-year agreement.</p>
