<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
