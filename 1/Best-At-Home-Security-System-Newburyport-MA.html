<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security bundle, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer burglaries throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. However, the reality that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers support authorities reaction to alarmed properties) a pricey and ineffective  method to robbery decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
