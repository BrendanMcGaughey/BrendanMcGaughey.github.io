<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends prospective culprits are less likely to commit criminal offense if they believe they are being seen or have a higher risk of being apprehended.

<p>I say sorry to all the Wink fans out there, but to call Wink Lookout a security system is a stretch. Lookout is actually simply a great name for a kit that includes a Wink smart home center and a couple of security oriented sensors. You can't disarm the system and arm. Instead, you turn alerts on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a regular self-monitored system can do like activate a camera to record or trigger the siren.
