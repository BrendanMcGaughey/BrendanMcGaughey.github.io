<p>You can utilize a wireless connection to run your SimpliSafe system, but it doesn't support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, indicating you will not have the ability to link it straight to other third-party gadgets like wise locks or automate specific actions in the home. You can, however, use Alexa to arm or disarm the SimpliSafe system and connect it to your Nest Thermostat to conserve energy based upon when you're home or away. But these combinations aren't quite as robust as the abode or Ring systems.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
