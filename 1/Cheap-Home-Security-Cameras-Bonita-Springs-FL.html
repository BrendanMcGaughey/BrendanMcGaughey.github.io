<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. If you want to watch on what's taking place in your house when you're not there, however you don't wish to purchase a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera is worth an appearance. These are the best indoor home security cameras in our testing. Aside from terrific equipment, Frontpoint utilizes 100% wireless equipment using cellular technology. Compared to landline security monitoring, cellular alarm systems are more secure as there are no disturbances even during bad weather. Frontpoint knows that the world is now changing to cellular alarm systems, and they was among the very first to utilize this technology in all their systems.</p>

Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally balanced out by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>
<p>So what occurs if something triggers your alarm but you remain in a meeting with a vendor and you don't get the alert?

If your system equipment consists of an audible alarm, the noise may scare off prospective intruders-- if you're lucky. But the police will not come until you personally call them.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
