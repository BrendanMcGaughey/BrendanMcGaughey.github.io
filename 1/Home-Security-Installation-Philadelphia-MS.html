<h2>CCTV Video Surveillance Philadelphia</h2>

Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the police if they happen regularly enough. Another potential drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
