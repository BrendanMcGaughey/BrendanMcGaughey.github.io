<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the maker's stats considering that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest culprit for short battery life by far.

These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is actually fantastic. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, however still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
