<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats given that this originates from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant offender for brief battery life by far.

Throughout screening, we discovered it was basic to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly activating when motion was spotted. We enjoy that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll require numerous Minuts throughout your property, which can get costly.
