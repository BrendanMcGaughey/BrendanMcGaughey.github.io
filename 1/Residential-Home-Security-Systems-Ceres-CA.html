<p>Unlike traditional burglar alarms, which have a control board (usually located in the entrance hall) that is utilized to arm and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensing units have actually been triggered, wise alarms are managed from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and informs you if any of the sensing units have actually been set off, rather than getting home to discover your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and possibly annoying your neighbours). However, wise alarms do require a center that permits the different elements to wirelessly link. But for most smart alarms this hub can be put anywhere in your home.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats given that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest perpetrator for short battery life without a doubt.

<p>Video surveillance is probably the next frontier for this innovation - and it's already available for enterprise-level video surveillance systems.
