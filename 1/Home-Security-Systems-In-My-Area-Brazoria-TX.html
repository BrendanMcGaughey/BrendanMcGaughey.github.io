<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
