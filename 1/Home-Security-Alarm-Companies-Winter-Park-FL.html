Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, consisting of clever things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. However the Secure is expensive, extra sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is likewise costly if you don't devote to a three-year contract.</p>
