<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the obligation of the entire neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a number of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to store and for how long you prepare to keep recorded video footage. The footage is going to consume up storage space rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage when you reach the system's capability, however if you're not cautious, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>
