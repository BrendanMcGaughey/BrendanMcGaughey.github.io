<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can record as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were often missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard clever home devices like automatic door locks, you can stay in bed and inspect that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you watch out for would-be package burglars or talk to visitors who come by.</p>

<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the picture quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day.
