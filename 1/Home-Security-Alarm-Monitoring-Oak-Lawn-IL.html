<p>Alarm monitoring is part of a complete home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (often exceptionally high decibel so that you can hear it as can next-door neighbors in some cases) and sounds an alarm with a professional monitoring company.

Then, the monitoring company instantly sets to action, connecting with you and informing the authorities.</p>
