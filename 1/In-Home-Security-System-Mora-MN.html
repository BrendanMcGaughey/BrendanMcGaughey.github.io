<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
