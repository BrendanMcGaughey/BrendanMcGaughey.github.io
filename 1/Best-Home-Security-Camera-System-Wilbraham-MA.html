<h3>Best House Security System in Wilbraham MA</h3>
<p>This self monitored alarm has 4 intelligent modes-- Home, Away, Night, and Personal. Based upon that, the camera switches on or off depending upon your place. The camera records 1080p videos with a 147-degree large angle lens that lessens all blind areas and gives you access to a larger field of view than most cameras. It is also equipped with a 3x digital zoom function that permits you to zoom in and record details such as facial features in case of break-ins.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to by hand stop notifications (and recording, considering that it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with 2 Hive test units detaching 8 times over 2 months. Scout is extremely simple to use, especially if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based internet browsers, and it permits you to control practically every element of the security system remotely, and it's extremely adjustable.

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually installed on the patio by a licensed electrical contractor (who occurs to be my spouse). All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be helpful for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof because it does not have wires that can be cut. Sadly I bought 4 cameras that look similar to these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Young boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is actually excellent.
