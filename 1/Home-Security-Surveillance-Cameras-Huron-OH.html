<p>At night, though it lacks the complete IR LED range of some competitors, the Arlo records enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight readily available if you're putting it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the great motion detection. Not just is the Arlo fast to choose moving products, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out exactly what it's taking a look at. Simply a couple decades back, the home security market was controlled by a few big names providing costly, rigid plans with little versatility and hostile, long-term agreements.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimal performance.
