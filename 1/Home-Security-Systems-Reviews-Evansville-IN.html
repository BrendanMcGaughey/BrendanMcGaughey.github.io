<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop.
