<p>Since the glass housing does not obstruct, they aren't quite as vandal-proof as dome cameras, however they make up for it in abilities. As well as being terrific for re-positioning on the fly, they are better for infrared and low-light because the glass housing does not impede the lens. With some, it's tough to tell at a glimpse where they have actually been intended, so they can offer a panoptic impression as a deterrent, regardless of their true field of view.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
