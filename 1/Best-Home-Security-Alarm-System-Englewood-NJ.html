However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to effectively detect motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it might leave you with recording spaces throughout crucial security occasions. If home security is your main issue, we 'd recommend one of our top choices, but the Arlo is excellent for checking in on household and family pets-- or stray felines sliding around your lawn.</p>
