<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring extensive but subtle changes to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or aware they may be viewed at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "understanding that you are being viewed by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You don't wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "individuals may learn to be careful about the regulars and books they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers." Certainly, the research studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals considered to be "out of time and place" with the environments were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>
