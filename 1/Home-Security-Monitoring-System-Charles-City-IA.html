<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and definitely like it. Excellent clarity. I wished to set up viewing on my cell phone however had a couple questions that the tech answered with ease. I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter alerts, for example. Nevertheless, those functions come at a comparatively steep rate: $5 each month ($50 each year) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 annually) for 1 month of video history.
