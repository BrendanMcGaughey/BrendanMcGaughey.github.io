The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise great metal building and construction.

Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
