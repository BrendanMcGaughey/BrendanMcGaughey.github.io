During screening, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we enjoy that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adapted to account for animals, too. The alarm system is just one of 2 we tested that consists of an external siren, and we're pleased that it also comes with a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further dissuading anybody from trying to break in to your residential or commercial property.
