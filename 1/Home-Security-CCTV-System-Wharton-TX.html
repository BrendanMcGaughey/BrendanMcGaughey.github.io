<p>Unlike conventional alarm systems, which have a control panel (typically located in the entryway hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensing units have actually been triggered, smart alarms are controlled from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have been set off, instead of getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially frustrating your neighbours).
