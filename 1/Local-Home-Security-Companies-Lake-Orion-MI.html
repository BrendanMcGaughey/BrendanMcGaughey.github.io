We recommend cellular systems since they're a lot more secure than landline systems, however there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>Everybody we handled at NSS were really practical and accommodating. The services they supplied were precisely what we wanted, and they carried out with professionalism and skills.
