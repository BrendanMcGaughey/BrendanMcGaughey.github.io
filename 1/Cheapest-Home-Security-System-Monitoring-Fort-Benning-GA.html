<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level.
