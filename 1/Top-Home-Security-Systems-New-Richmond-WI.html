The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
